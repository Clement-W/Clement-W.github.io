    - name: Music
      courseOverview: Guitarist for more than 10 years, I co-managed the music association of ENSC from 2020 to 2022. This involved managing a rehearsal room, giving guitar lessons and organizing concerts. I'm always up for jamming with other musicians!

    - name: Astronomy
      courseOverview: I have always been passionate about space and astrophysical phenomenas. I have a Dobson 254/1200 that makes me able to observe beautiful deep sky objects, but only when it's not raining in Normandy ;)
