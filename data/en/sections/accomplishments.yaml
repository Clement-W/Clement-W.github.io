    - name: Music
      courseOverview: Guitarist for almost 10 years, I co-run the school's music association. This involves managing a rehearsal room, giving guitar lessons and organizing concerts. What I like the most is to improvise with other musicians !

    - name: Astronomy
      courseOverview: I have always been passionate about space, the stars and astrophysical phenomena. Thanks to my telescope, a Dobson 254/1200, I am able to see planets or deep sky objects with my own eyes! I am also starting Astrophotography, I will post some pictures on this website very soon.
